                        <br> The negative impact of a digital life that I chose to focus on is <br>
                        how social media and the rise of photoshopped images distorts many <br>
                        digital user’s perception of reality. Many young people often posts <br>
                        perfect pictures on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, <br>
                        Youtube, and in this example, Instagram. The purpose of this is <br>
                        usually just to share or advertise experiences and products on social <br>
                        media. However, with this, also comes with the formation of a false <br>
                        sense of reality in which users sometimes attempt to achieve —  <br>
                        affecting their mental health.

                        <br> There are many interface features on Instagram that <br>
                        encourages sharing and posting through its Instagram feed, stories, <br>
                         TV and direct messaging. For example, the feed and discover page<br>
                          are both designed as an endless scroll — allowing users to use <br>
                          the app for hours on end. Instagram stories encourages users to <br>
                          constantly keep checking the app for updates on their following’s <br>
                          stories as they only appear for 24 hours and is regularly updated.  </div>
